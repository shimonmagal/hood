This is hood - a server written in java and client (mobile app) written in flutter.

This project was a good excuse for me to learn flutter and also cooperate with a dear friend - https://github.com/dvdlevanon

This project allows you to create "Flyers" at the location where you are, and others that log in, can see the 20 flyers closest to them and the distances these flyers are from them,
virtually replacing the need for a physical bulletin board in your neighbour hood.

We now also support a chat feature to interact with the publisher of the flyer.
We decided not to make commercial use of this code for now, and so published the code so that others may get inspired and choose to implement a better version of what we did.

Good luck!
